# Contributing Guide
If you're reading this, it means you're interested in helping by contributing some of your time to the development of this codebase and we are glad.

The API for [govote](https://govote.org.ng) was built with [Koa](http://koajs.com/), an expressive framework for Node.js. It is super easy to get started with and has great documentation.

## Submitting changes

Ensure that you fork out of the `dev` branch and then you can branch out and create a new branch in the following manner:

`your initials` - `feature you're working on`

An example would be:

`os-candidates-feature`

When you're done, please send a GitHub Pull Request to govote-app with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 


Please follow the standard conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

Thanks!
